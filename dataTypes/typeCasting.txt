 Type casting means storing the different data type values into different data types. 

Eg. 

   Int x = 5.9 

   float y = 8;

This phenomenon is called type casting or type conversion. There are two types of type casting.


Implicit type casting.


Explicit typecasting. (needed a type casting operator. Eg. int x = (int)5.9)

All data types can not be typecast to all data types.

 Eg.


float k = (int)9.17  // k = 9.000


int x = 1000000000, y = 1000000000;

int z = x * y;

printf(“%d”,z);

Is there any problem with the above code snippet? Yes, there will be an integer overflow, because 109 * 109 will give the integer overflow. Only changing z to long long int will not work because the multiplication of two integers will store the result into integers then it will type cast to long long.

product is not being type casted to long, rather x is getting converted to long, and hence long * int is resulting in long

 Long long int z = (long)x * y;
